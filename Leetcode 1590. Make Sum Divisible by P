Why Sliding Window Fails with Modulo Conditions :-

Overview

The sliding window technique is a powerful method often used for solving problems related to subarrays and sequences.
However, its effectiveness can diminish in cases where the solution relies on non-monotonic behavior, particularly when 
modulo operations are involved. This document outlines the limitations of the sliding window approach in such scenarios and 
provides an example to illustrate the concept.
Non-Monotonic Behavior
The crux of the issue lies in the unpredictable nature of how the sum of elements within a sliding window behaves when subjected 
to modulo operations. Specifically, altering the size of the window—whether by expanding or contracting it—does not guarantee a 
consistent or predictable change in the modulo result of the current window sum. This non-monotonicity poses challenges for applying the 
sliding window technique effectively.

Example
Consider the following array and a modulo condition:

Array: arr = [5, 7, 2, 3, 6]
Modulo Value (p): 4
The total sum of the array is:
5 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 23
When we calculate 23 mod 4, we find:
23 mod 4 = 3
Our goal is to find subarrays where the sum of elements, when taken modulo 4, equals 3.

Checking Subarrays
Now, let’s explore different windows and their corresponding sums and modulo results:
Window [5]:
window_sum = 5
5 mod 4 = 1 (no match)
Window [5, 7]:
window_sum = 12
12 mod 4 = 0 (no match)
Window [5, 7, 2]:
window_sum = 14
14 mod 4 = 2 (no match)
Window [5, 7, 2, 3]:
window_sum = 17
17 mod 4 = 1 (no match)
Window [5, 7, 2, 3, 6]:
window_sum = 23
23 mod 4 = 3 (match)
Now, we will make our window smaller and see, we still meet our condition
Window [7, 2, 3, 6]:
window_sum = 18
18 mod 4 = 2 (no match)
So, the min length we will get will be 5 but in reality it will be 1 i.e. [3]
Analysis
As we adjust the window by adding and removing elements, the modulo values do not follow a consistent or predictable path.
Alternative Approaches
Due to the non-monotonic behavior induced by modulo conditions, alternative strategies should be considered:

Prefix Sums: Using prefix sums allows for efficient calculations of subarray sums without the overhead of adjusting the window.
Hash Maps: Utilizing hash maps to track occurrences of modulo results can help identify valid subarrays more efficiently.
Conclusion

The sliding window technique, while highly effective for many problems, encounters significant limitations when applied to scenarios involving modulo conditions. 
The non-monotonic behavior of the window sum in relation to its modulo value necessitates a shift toward other methodologies to achieve efficient and accurate results. 
Understanding these constraints is crucial for choosing the right algorithm for a given problem.
